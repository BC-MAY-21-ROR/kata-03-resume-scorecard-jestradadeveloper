  title: About Me # NO MODIFICAR
  summary: |
    I am a computer systems engineer with 4 years of experience in website development mostly from the hotel marketing industry.  Half of my experience is developing websites with wordpress and the other half maintaining and developing pages for hotels with the Ruby on Rails Framework. Currently I live in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and  I like cooking a lot because I find it very relaxing. I also go to the gym regularly. I like to swim and go out on weekends to explore hidden places in the mountains.I like the discipline, and my greatest quality is that I am very persistent.

  - role: Ruby On Rails Web Developer
    time: 2019 - Present
    company: Villagroup, Loreto BC
    details: |
      My position was as a ruby ​​on rails web defeater. My experience working for
      the Villagroup hotel chain in Puerto Vallarta has consisted in the 
      administration and deployment of websites for hotels that are developed 
      in Ruby on Rails. I am part of a small hotel marketing team in Puerto Vallarta
      and as new needs arise related to the website, adjustments, redesigns and 
      additions, I must make sure that these applications are in production
      using Amazon Web Services( EC2, S3, Route 53). 
      I have also had to consume APIs that are specialy designed to feed the room 
      rates for the hotels that I am responsible. Here I have also been fullstack
      since my tasks are both in frontend and backend, plus the administration of 
      the infrastructure in Amazon. These are some of the activities I do:
        
        - Redesign or development of new websites for hotels
        - UX enhancement design
        - Data analysis for site improvement
        - Tests AB
        - SEO Tecnical Performance analysis 
        - Database Administration on MySql
        - Deployments on EC2 Amazon with Nginx and Passenger


  - role: Fullstack Web Developer
    time: 2017 - 2019
    company: OH Travel Marketing, Puerto Vallarta
    details: |
      I worked for oh marketing for 2 years where I was a web developer, 
      initially doing several projects focused on the tourism sector, mainly for
      the design, development and deployment of hotel websites, convention centers 
      and the tourist destination of Puerto Vallarta.
      My functions were as a fullstack web developer since while we developed 
      the entiry process of the creation of the websites using php for wordpress, we 
      also had to implement everything necessary in the server infrastructure 
      where these sites should be hosted through the aws services of amazon. 
      Mostly my experience was developing websites with wordpress but there 
      was a project for which we worked for a major hotel chain in the 
      Caribbean in which we made a site using Laravel.
